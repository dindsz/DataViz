Covid-19 Risk Management Technique in Indonesia using GE-Matrix analysis
## Project Overview
The occurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic which has lasted almost two years has changed the lives of people around the world, especially Indonesia. During that time, the government continued to make efforts to issue policies to deal with the risks caused by this disease. Data visualization can help in decision making. Visualization of data in the health sector is one of the elements in a framework called Evidence-Based Public Health (EBPH). The use of the GE-Matrix can help the decision-making process which in practice in the public health sector has not been widely adopted.

## Project Details
Visualization created using Tableau. New case per million is using [Kaggle Covid-19 Dataset Indonesia](https://www.kaggle.com/hendratno/covid19-indonesia?select=covid_19_indonesia_time_series_all.csv). Bed Occupancy Ratio (BOR) is using [BOR Dataset](https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2021/08/02/bor-rumah-sakit-covid-19-di-17-provinsi-lebih-dari-60-mana-saja).
